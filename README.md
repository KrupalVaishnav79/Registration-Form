# Simple Registration and Authentication React App

## Introduction

This is a React application that I have developed as part of an assignment for a company. It demonstrates a basic user registration and authentication system using React's `useState` hook and local storage. The purpose of this assignment is to showcase my skills in web development and React.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can enter their name and password in the registration form and click the "GO" button to register.

- **User Login**: After registration, users can log in by entering their credentials.

- **Local Storage**: User data is stored in the browser's local storage as `token-info` when registered. This data is used to determine whether a user is logged in or not.

- **Log Out**: Users can log out, which removes their data from local storage and logs them out.
